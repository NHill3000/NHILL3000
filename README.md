# Hi, I'm Nick 



### Chemoinformatics Leader | ⚛️ Applied AI Practitioner | 🧬 Quantum Computing Enthusiast



Welcome to my GitHub profile — a collection of independent and side projects in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and quantum computing.  

These repositories represent personal experimentation and selected coursework projects, extended beyond my professional work at my day job.



Proprietary or internal cheminformatics work from my professional role is intentionally excluded.

## 🧪 About Me



I have over 10 years of experience spanning chemical R&D. In my most recent role I focus on applying machine learning and computational methods to enhance molecular analysis, R&D productivity, and strategic technology initiatives.



This GitHub serves as a space to complement that work showing how I explore, build, and reason about AI systems independently.  

My goal is to combine scientific understanding with practical AI applications that are reproducible, interpretable, and relevant to real-world challenges.
